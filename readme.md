# Golang Todo App

Golang Todo App is a simple todo app backend created to teach how to create CRUD REST APis with Golang and Mongo DB for database. I wrote about how to build a simple golang todo app and this is the github repository for the todo project built in the article.

If you are new to programming or a Dev who desires to learn Golang, this is a way you can slowly introduce yourself to the language and understand the basics and how building APIs work in Go.

For the full-stack version, which includes the frontend built with TypeScript and Fetch API, check this branch [frontend-with-ts](https://github.com/Kellswork/golang-todo-app/tree/frontend-with-ts)
